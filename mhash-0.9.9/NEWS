People

   NM - Nikos Mavroyanopoulos <nmav@hellug.gr>
   SS - Sascha Schumann <sascha@schumann.cx>

Version 0.9.9
- Added patch for sigbus error on unaligned data, when doing rapid copies.
  (Thanks to Wayne - mhash@useunix.net - for that.)

Version 0.9.8.1
- Another round of bugfixes

Version 0.9.8
- As before - more patches and cleanups

Version 0.9.7
- More patches, more cleanups. Better handling of endian issues. Should
  handle platforms that do weird things with booleans better. Eliminated
  more redundant code. Snefru is now endian-aware. Maybe.

Known Issues:
- Sub-optimal on 64-bit platforms, as a lot of the code assumes 32-bits.
- May be some big-endian issues remaining. make check is your friend!

Version 0.9.6
- Bunch of patches and speedups. Credits to be added.

Version 0.9.2
- Added SNEFRU128, SNEFRU256. Reintroduced MD2.
  (jkmhash@itaparica.org)
- Fixes to .spec file and clean-ups of documentation
  (cpedersen[at]c-note.dk)
- Fixed typecasts, memory leaks and compiler warnings
  (imipak@yahoo.com)

		INSTALLATION for mcrypt

If compilation fails because of gettext (nls code), use the --disable-nls,
if you want to disable internationalization, or --with-included-gettext, if
you want to enable it, as a parameter to configure script. On IRIX 6.4
there is a problem with the nls code, so use --disable-nls.

If you're installing with nls support, follow the instructions in ABOUT-NLS
file. Briefly put in the environment parameter LINGUAS the
characters which identify your country's language according to iso639 
(eg. "el" for greek language).
